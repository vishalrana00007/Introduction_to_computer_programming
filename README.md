The Introduction to Computer Programming project is designed to evaluate our understanding and practical application of fundamental programming concepts using Python. 
This assessment encompasses various topics, including data types, indexing, slicing, operators, in-built functions, statements, conditionals, loops, object-oriented programming, and exception handling. 
In addition, it will showcase our ability to create custom functions and tackle advanced looping concepts.
